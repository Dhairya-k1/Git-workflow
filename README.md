Git Workflow Manager ðŸš€
The Git Workflow Manager is a tool designed to streamline the Git experience, making version control more efficient, less prone to error and intuitive for developers of all skill levels. By abstracting away complex commands and automating common workflows, it allows developers to focus on writing code rather than managing version controlÂ complexities.

How to Use
To use the functionality, navigate to your Git repository in Git Bash and run the following command:

python main.py suggest

The tool will then output a list of suggested Git commands and explain the reason for each suggestion.
